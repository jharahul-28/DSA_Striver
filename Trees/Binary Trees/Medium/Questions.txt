 Q1 Height of a binary tree
     https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/
     Recursively we find the height of the left subtree and the right subtree and find the max of the both

 Q2 Check balanced binary tree
     https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/description/

 Q3 Diameter of a binary tree
     https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/
     Sum of largest depth of the left node-1 and largest depth of the rigth node-1, subtracting 1 because no. of edges = depth -1

 Q4 Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
     https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/
     We find the left sum and see if it is > 0, same for right, we calculate maxSum then we see which is greater left or right and return that

 Q5 Same Tree
     https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/
     For each node check the val and check its left and right child

 Q6 ZigZag traversal
     https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/description/
     We keep a flag to know whether we have to go l2r or r2l, rest is same as level order traversal
