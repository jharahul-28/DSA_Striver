     Like common subsequence we code the tabulation but because its substring , if characters dont match then we store 0 as answer.

 Q4 Longest Palindromic Subsequence
     https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/description/
     We store the reverse of the string in another string, as we have to check palindrome, now we find LCS of the two string

 Q5 Minimum insertions to make a string palindrome
     https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome/description/
     We store the size of the Longest Palindromic Subsequence, and subtract it from the size of the string as those many letters are missing
