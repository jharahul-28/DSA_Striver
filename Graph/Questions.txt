 Q1 BFS
     We take a visited array, and will mark 1 for those which are visited, initialised each index with 0. we will take a queue and push neighbours and pop to store the next neighbours and mark them as visited.

 Q2 DFS
     Similar to BFS , instead of breadth traersal we do depth traversal using recurrsion.

 Q3 No. of provinces- those nodes which are connected by edges, either directly or indirectly constitute a province
     We traverse the adj list and upon finding an unvisited node we increase the counter and do dfs/bfs, all nodes constituting a province are visited and we move forward in traverse and look for unvisited and the process continues. TC: O(N) + O(v + 2e)
