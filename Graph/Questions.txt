 Q1 BFS
     We take a visited array, and will mark 1 for those which are visited, initialised each index with 0. we will take a queue and push neighbours and pop to store the next neighbours and mark them as visited.

 Q2 DFS
     Similar to BFS , instead of breadth traersal we do depth traversal using recurrsion.
